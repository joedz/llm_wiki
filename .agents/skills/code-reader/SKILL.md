# Deep Code Reader

Systematically read and understand a codebase, producing a set of verified cognitive skills that capture deep knowledge — module capabilities, design logic, data structures, state flow, and modification guides.

The core mechanism: a closed-book exam verification loop ensures generated skills are genuinely comprehensive, not shallow summaries.

## 1. The Team Roles

To make this process robust and conceptually clear, the system employs three distinct agents modeled after a software engineering team:

- **Agent A (Tech Writer)**: The deep reader. Reads the source code and writes the comprehensive skill document.
- **Agent B (QA Engineer)**: The examiner. Reads the source code, extracts verifiable facts, and generates test questions.
- **Agent C (Junior Dev)**: The candidate. Acts as a new team member who can ONLY read the document written by Agent A to answer Agent B's questions.

## 2. Usage

Here is the CLI command to trigger the deep-code-read workflow:

```bash
/deep-code-read <source> <output-dir>
```

- **source**: local path (e.g., `./path/to/repo`) or GitHub URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo`)
- **output-dir**: where generated skills are written (e.g., your platform's skills directory)

## 3. Full Flow

You MUST follow these phases in order. Track progress across modules using your platform's task/todo tracking mechanism.

### 3.1 Phase 1: Prepare

This initial phase handles the resolution and preparation of the target source codebase.

1. Determine the project name:
   - Local path → directory name
   - GitHub URL → repo name
2. If source is a URL:
   - Clone to `{output-dir}/{project-name}/`
   - If the directory already exists, skip cloning and use it
3. If source is a local path:
   - Verify the path exists and is a git repo
   - Use it directly (read-only — do NOT modify any files in the source repo)
4. Detect version:
   - Run `git tag --list` in the source repo
   - If tags exist, sort with semver-aware ordering (handle `v` prefix), recommend the latest
   - If no reasonable tags, recommend `main` or `master` branch
5. **PAUSE — present recommendation to user:**
   > "Detected the following tags/branches: [list]. I recommend tracking `{recommended}`. Confirm or specify a different target."
6. Checkout the confirmed ref

### 3.2 Phase 2: Scan

This phase scans the repository structure to identify boundaries and dependencies.

1. Scan the source repo directory structure
2. Identify module boundaries using heuristics:
   - Top-level directories under `src/`, `lib/`, `pkg/`, `packages/`, or project root
   - Language-specific patterns: Python packages (`__init__.py`), Go packages, Node packages (`package.json`), etc.
   - Look for existing module documentation or manifest files
3. Analyze import/dependency relationships between modules
4. **PAUSE — present module list and dependency graph to user:**
   > "Found the following modules: [list with one-line descriptions]. Select which modules to deep-read (or 'all')."
5. Record the user's selection — one task per selected module

### 3.3 Phase 3: Deep Read (Agent A - Tech Writer)

This phase generates the foundational skill documents.

For each selected module, dispatch a subagent with the prompt template from `references/tech-writer-prompt.md`.

**Subagent dispatch parameters:**

- `prompt`: rendered `tech-writer-prompt.md` with variables filled in
- `description`: "Deep read {module-name}"

**Variables to fill in the prompt:**

- `{source-dir}`: path to the source repo
- `{module-dir}`: path to the specific module within the source repo
- `{output-dir}`: the skill output directory
- `{project-name}`: extracted project name
- `{module-name}`: the module name
- `{ref}`: the tracked tag/branch

After Tech Writer completes, verify the skill files were written to `{output-dir}/{project-name}-fj-{module-name}/`. Update the module's task status.

### 3.4 Phase 4: Verify (ABC Loop)

This phase executes the core verification loop to ensure the generated skills are accurate and complete.

For each module that has generated skills, run the verification cycle:

**Step 1 — Agent B / QA Engineer (question generation):**

Dispatch a subagent with `references/qa-engineer-prompt.md`, using a lightweight/smaller model (e.g., Haiku-class).

**Subagent dispatch parameters:**

- `prompt`: rendered `qa-engineer-prompt.md`
- `model`: a smaller, cheaper model — the weaker the better (if it catches gaps, those gaps are real)
- `description`: "Generate questions for {module-name}"

**Variables:**

- `{source-dir}`, `{module-dir}`, `{module-name}`
- `{previous_questions}`: empty string for the first round

QA Engineer returns two sets:

- Verification questions with answer keys (JSON array)
- Recommended questions for user (JSON array)

Save the recommended questions (keep in context for Phase 6). Accumulate all verification questions asked so far across rounds.

**Step 2 — Agent C / Junior Dev (closed-book answer):**

Dispatch a subagent with `references/junior-dev-prompt.md`.

**Subagent dispatch parameters:**

- `prompt`: rendered `junior-dev-prompt.md` with verification questions embedded
- `description`: "Verify skills for {module-name}"

**Variables:**

- `{skill-dir}`: `{output-dir}/{project-name}-dr-{module-name}/`
- `{questions}`: the verification questions from QA Engineer (without answer keys)

Junior Dev returns answers to each question.

**Step 3 — Evaluate:**

Use your own reasoning (as the main orchestrator) to evaluate Junior Dev's answers:
For each question, check Junior Dev's answer against QA Engineer's `required_facts` list:

- An answer PASSES if it covers ALL required facts (exact match or semantic equivalent)
- An answer FAILS if it misses any required fact
- This is an objective check, not a subjective judgment. Extract the JSON outputs from QA Engineer and Junior Dev carefully, ignoring any markdown formatting (like `json`).

**Step 4 — Loop or proceed:**

**HARD RULE: You MUST continue looping until 100% of verification questions pass OR you have completed exactly 3 rounds. There is NO early exit. A pass rate of 99% is still a failure — loop again.**

- 100% pass → module verified, update task, move to next module
- ANY question fails (even one) → you MUST continue to the next round:
  1. Collect failed questions with: the question, QA Engineer's answer key, Junior Dev's failed answer
  2. Feed these back to Tech Writer: dispatch again with the `{feedback}` variable containing the failed questions, QA Engineer's expected answer keys, and the gaps identified.
  3. Re-run QA Engineer and Junior Dev, passing ALL previous questions (from all rounds) as `{previous_questions}` so QA Engineer generates new questions instead of repeating old ones
  4. Evaluate again — repeat until 100% or 3 rounds completed
- **After exactly 3 rounds with failures remaining** → show the unresolved questions and pass rates to the user for judgment. Do NOT silently move on.

**Do NOT rationalize stopping early.** "Good enough", "most questions passed", "diminishing returns" are not valid reasons to skip a round. The loop exists to catch gaps — use all 3 rounds if needed.

### 3.5 Phase 5: Generate Global Index

This phase consolidates the verified module skills into a global index file.

After all modules are verified, generate `{output-dir}/{project-name}-dr/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: {project-name}-dr
description: Use when working with {project-name} codebase — provides comprehensive module knowledge, design logic, and modification guides (generated from {ref})
---
```

Content must include:

- Repo source (GitHub URL if applicable, or local path)
- Version: tag or commit hash
- Tracked branch
- Generation timestamp
- Each module's one-line purpose (from the module skills)
- Inter-module dependency relationships (from Phase 2 scan)
- Cross-module scenario entry guides: for common operations that span multiple modules, describe which modules are involved and in what order

To generate cross-module scenarios, read ALL the module skills and synthesize typical user workflows.

### 3.6 Phase 6: User Acceptance

This phase presents the results to the user for final validation.

Present the recommended questions collected from Phase 4:

> "Skills generated and verified. Here are some questions you might want to test:
> [list recommended questions]
>
> Feel free to ask any question about {project-name}. I'll answer using ONLY the generated skills."

When answering user questions in this phase:

- Read ONLY the generated skill files in `{output-dir}/{project-name}-fj*/`
- Do NOT read source code
- If you cannot answer a question from the skills alone, say so honestly — this indicates a gap

Continue until the user is satisfied or decides to end the session.

### 3.7 Phase 7: Cleanup

This final phase handles the cleanup of temporary files if necessary.

If the source was cloned from a URL (i.e., `{output-dir}/{project-name}/` was created in Phase 1):

> "Skills are ready. The cloned source code is at `{output-dir}/{project-name}/`. Want me to delete it to save disk space, or keep it for reference?"

- User says delete → remove the cloned directory
- User says keep → leave it as is

Skip this phase if the source was a local path (we never cloned anything).

## 4. Key Rules

Strictly adhere to the following rules during the entire execution process:

- **Never modify source code** — the source repo is read-only throughout
- **Agent isolation is critical** — each agent's prompt strictly defines what it can read
- **Skills must be self-sufficient** — the verification loop exists to ensure this
- **Track progress** — every module is a task, updated as it progresses through phases
- **Format via writing-skills** — Tech Writer follows `superpowers:writing-skills` formatting conventions (frontmatter, CSO description, directory structure) but does NOT run the full writing-skills TDD cycle
