# LLM Wiki Local API Skill

Talk to the user's locally-running LLM Wiki app over its built-in HTTP API. This is a **standard JSON API** — call it directly with whatever HTTP tool is already in your environment (`curl`, `fetch`, `requests`, `http` middleware, etc.). No client library to install, no SDK to learn.

Treat the wiki as a **private, structured knowledge base** the user has been curating: pages live as `wiki/**.md`, raw documents under `raw/sources/`, wikilinks form a graph.

## When to invoke

Invoke **only** when the user is clearly referring to **LLM Wiki** specifically — by app name, by `wiki` framing, or by `知识库` framing. Concretely:

- asks a question framed as "what does my **wiki** / my **knowledge base** / 我的**知识库** / **LLM Wiki** say about X"
- asks to "search **my wiki** / **LLM Wiki** project / 我的**知识库** for X"
- references a **wiki page** by stem / title and wants to read or cross-link
- asks for the **wiki graph / 知识图谱 / wiki overview / wiki structure**
- has just added or edited files under the LLM Wiki **source folder** and wants ingest re-run / **重新索引**
- says "use **my wiki** for context" / "ground your answer in **my wiki**" / "check **my LLM Wiki**"
- names a wiki project (by ID, by absolute path, or by `current`)

**Do NOT invoke when the user says:**

- "search **my notes**" without further qualification — likely Obsidian / Apple Notes / Notion / Logseq / Bear / etc.
- "find in **my notebook**" — likely Jupyter / OneNote / Notability
- "check **my Obsidian / Notion / Roam / Logseq vault**" — explicitly a different tool
- "look up **my Anki / Readwise / Pocket**" — different tool
- "search **my files / my Documents folder**" — generic filesystem, not the wiki
- general world knowledge, current events, or anything the user clearly wants from the open web

When in doubt about which knowledge tool the user means, ask: *"Do you mean your LLM Wiki specifically, or another tool?"* — don't silently call the LLM Wiki API on what might be an Obsidian vault.

## Quick start

The whole API is plain HTTP + JSON. The fastest path:

```bash
BASE=http://127.0.0.1:19828
TOKEN="${LLM_WIKI_API_TOKEN:-<paste-from-Settings>}"

# 1. probe state — no auth needed
curl -s $BASE/api/v1/health

# 2. list projects
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $BASE/api/v1/projects

# 3. search
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"rope embedding","topK":5}' \
  $BASE/api/v1/projects/current/search

# 4. read a page
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$BASE/api/v1/projects/current/files/content?path=wiki/concepts/rope.md"
```

If you're writing TypeScript / JavaScript:

```ts
const res = await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:19828/api/v1/projects/current/search", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.LLM_WIKI_API_TOKEN}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: "rope embedding", topK: 5 }),
})
const { results } = await res.json()
```

Python is the same shape — `urllib.request`, `requests`, `httpx`, whatever you already have. **Don't install anything new.**

## Auth model

The API is **localhost-only**. The token is one of:

1. `LLM_WIKI_API_TOKEN` environment variable (if set, overrides UI)
2. The user's `apiConfig.token` saved via Settings → API Server
3. `allowUnauthenticated: true` mode (no token needed; rare, user opt-in only)

Always check `/api/v1/health` first — it returns `{ enabled, authConfigured, allowUnauthenticated, tokenSource }`. **If `authConfigured: false && allowUnauthenticated: false`, ask the user to open `Settings → API Server → Generate new token`**. Do not proceed without auth being set up.

Three equivalent ways to send the token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>          # preferred
X-LLM-Wiki-Token: <token>              # alternative header
?token=<urlencoded-token>              # query param — last resort, leaks into logs
```

**Never log or echo the token. Never put it in any URL the user can see in your output** (Referer / shell history / logs all leak it).

## Standard workflow

When the user asks "look it up in my wiki":

1. **Resolve project** (see [Project resolution](#project-resolution) below).
2. **Search**: `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/search` with `{ query, topK: 5..10 }` → ranked hits (`path`, `title`, `snippet`, `score`, `titleMatch`, optional `vectorScore`, `images`). Inspect `response.mode` to know whether hybrid retrieval kicked in.
3. **Read top hits**: for each promising hit, `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/files/content?path=...` for the full markdown. Or pass `includeContent: true` to the search to avoid the round-trip.
4. **Cite + answer**: synthesize an answer grounded in the read pages. **Quote the `path` of each page you used** so the user can verify and jump in-app.

### Reading the score

The `score` field's scale depends on `mode`:

- **`mode: "keyword"`** — additive keyword score. Filename-exact hits are ~200; phrase-in-title ~50+; bag-of-tokens lands in single digits. Treat anything below ~5% of the top result as low-confidence.
- **`mode: "hybrid"` or `"vector"`** — RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) score, typically in the **0.015–0.035** range. The absolute number is small; relative ordering is what matters. Use the per-result `vectorScore` (raw cosine 0–1) for "how strongly did the embedding match" if you need it.

Don't apply a fixed score threshold across modes. Sort by `score` descending and rely on relative gaps.

### Project resolution

`{id}` in every project-scoped endpoint accepts **four forms**:

| Form | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `current` (literal) | Default for "my wiki / 我的知识库 / this project / this wiki". The user is referring to whatever is open in the desktop UI. | `/api/v1/projects/current/search` |
| UUID | The user pasted a project ID, OR you previously resolved a name to an ID and want to re-use it. | `/api/v1/projects/a0e90b29-fcf3-4364-9502-8bd1272de820/files` |
| Absolute filesystem path (URL-encoded) | The user named the path (e.g. `~/notes/research`). Useful when the user has multiple projects with similar names. | `/api/v1/projects/%2FUsers%2Fme%2Fwiki%2Fresearch/files` |
| Project name | **Not supported directly.** You must `GET /api/v1/projects` first, find a match by `name`, then use that project's `id`. |

**Decision tree** for what the user said:

```
"my wiki" / "my 知识库" / "this wiki" / "this project" / unspecified
    → use `current`

"my Research project" / "in Reading"
    → GET /api/v1/projects
    → name-match (case-insensitive substring on `name`)
    → use the resulting `id`
    → if 0 matches: tell the user, list available names, fall back to `current` only if they confirm
    → if 2+ matches: ask the user to disambiguate, quoting both names + paths

"the project at /Users/me/foo"
    → URL-encode the path, use directly
    → if the API returns 404, the project isn't registered — list and let user pick

"project a0e90b29-…"
    → use the UUID literally
```

Cache the resolved `id` for the rest of the conversation — there's no need to re-`GET /projects` for every call. But if the user switches contexts mid-conversation ("now look in my Reading project"), re-resolve.

When the user is silent about which project, **default to `current`** and mention it once: *"Looking in your active project (Research Notes)…"*. This avoids cross-project surprises.

For graph / cross-reference questions:

- `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/graph?limit=200` → `{ nodes: [{id, label, nodeType, path, linkCount}], edges: [{source, target, weight}] }`
- Filter via `?q=term` (substring of id/label, case-insensitive) and `?nodeType=entity|concept|...`

For "I added new docs" requests:

- `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/sources/rescan` → returns `{ queue: { tasks }, changedTasks: [...] }`. Tell the user how many files changed. Actual ingest runs asynchronously via the desktop queue.

## Endpoint contract (v1)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/health` | No auth. Returns `{ ok, status, version, enabled, authRequired, authConfigured, allowUnauthenticated, tokenSource }`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/projects` | List projects. Each: `{ id, name, path, current }`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/files?root=wiki\|sources\|all&recursive=true&maxFiles=2000` | Tree of `{ name, path, isDir, size, children }`. Capped at 10000 nodes (413). |
| GET | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/files/content?path=wiki/foo.md` | Text files only (md/mdx/txt/json/yaml/yml/csv/html/htm/xml/rtf/log). 2 MB max. 415 on binary, 413 on oversize, 403 on out-of-scope path. |
| POST | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/search` | Body: `{ "query": "...", "topK": 10, "includeContent": false }`. **Hybrid (keyword + vector)** when the user has embeddings configured in Settings; falls back to keyword-only otherwise. Response carries `mode: "keyword" \| "vector" \| "hybrid"`, plus `tokenHits` / `vectorHits` and per-result `vectorScore`. Empty query → 400. |
| GET | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/graph?q=&nodeType=&limit=200` | Wikilinks graph from `wiki/*.md`. Limit clamped to 1000. |
| POST | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/sources/rescan` | Triggers a backend rescan using the user's Source Watch config. Returns post-rescan queue + actually-changed tasks. |
| POST | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/chat` | Chat with LLM using wiki as context. Body: `{"message": "...", "stream": false}`. Returns `{"ok": true, "response": "...markdown...", "references": [...], "warnings": []}`. See [Chat endpoint](#chat-endpoint) for details. |

`{id}` accepts a UUID, an absolute filesystem path (URL-encoded), or the literal string `current`.

## Chat endpoint

The `/api/v1/projects/{id}/chat` endpoint allows conversational queries grounded in the wiki knowledge base.

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:19828/api/v1/projects/current/chat" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"your question","stream":false}'
```

**Request body fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `message` | string | ✅ | The question or query (English recommended for best results) |
| `stream` | boolean | ❌ | `true` for streaming response, `false` (default) for synchronous full response |

**⚠️ Note:** The `message` field name is `message`, **not** `query`. Using `query` will return a 400 error.

**⚠️ Note:** Non-ASCII characters (e.g., Chinese) in `message` may trigger UTF-8 encoding issues with the underlying Minimax API. Use English for reliable results.

### Response

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "response": "# AI 智能体（AI Agent）\n\n## 基本定义\n\n**智能体（Agent）** 是能够自主感知环境...",
  "references": [
    {
      "kind": "wiki",
      "path": "wiki/concepts/ai-native-agent.md",
      "snippet": "--- type: concept title: AI原生智能体...",
      "title": "AI原生智能体"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

**Response fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ok` | boolean | Whether the request succeeded |
| `response` | string | Markdown-formatted answer from the LLM |
| `references` | array | Wiki pages used to ground the answer (each with `kind`, `path`, `snippet`, `title`) |
| `warnings` | array | Any warnings (usually empty) |

### Reference object shape

Each item in `references`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `kind` | string | Always `"wiki"` for wiki pages |
| `path` | string | Full path to the wiki page (e.g., `wiki/concepts/ai-native-agent.md`) |
| `snippet` | string | Frontmatter + first ~200 chars of the page content |
| `title` | string | Page title extracted from frontmatter |

### Usage notes

- The LLM uses the wiki pages as context to answer questions conversationally
- `references` cites which wiki pages informed the response — quote the `path` so the user can verify and jump to the page in-app
- For best results, use **English** in the `message` field
- `stream: false` (default) returns the complete response synchronously
- Set `stream: true` for streaming responses (progressive output)

## Error handling

Always treat the status code as the contract:

| Status | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | OK | Use `body.ok === true` belt-and-suspenders; payload is in the same object. |
| 400 | Bad request | Show `body.error`. Typical: empty `query`, invalid `?root=`, oversized body. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Token missing/wrong. Tell user to set/regenerate in Settings → API Server. |
| 403 | Forbidden | Path traversal or out-of-scope (e.g. `../app-state.json`). Don't retry the same path. |
| 404 | Not found | Unknown project id or unknown route. On unknown project, list projects first to recover. |
| 405 | Method not allowed | Wrong HTTP verb. |
| 413 | Payload too large | File > 2 MB, file tree > maxFiles, or request body > 1 MB. Suggest narrower scope. |
| 415 | Unsupported media | Binary or non-UTF-8 file content. API is text-only. |
| 429 | Too many requests | Rate limit (120 req/sec global). Back off ≥1 second. |
| 500 | Internal error | Log + report; don't loop. |
| 501 | Not implemented | Endpoint not available (not a /chat issue). |
| 503 | Service unavailable | Two flavors: API toggled off (`error` contains "disabled"); in-flight cap (64) reached ("busy"). Back off ≥2s. |

If the HTTP call itself fails (connection refused / ENOTFOUND): the desktop app is **not running**. Tell the user: "Launch LLM Wiki, then re-try."

## Etiquette

- **Cite paths.** When you answer using wiki content, name the page: `(from wiki/concepts/rope.md)`. The user uses these to verify and to jump in-app.
- **Stay read-only by default.** Only `sources/rescan` mutates state; everything else is reads. Don't invent write endpoints — they don't exist in v1.
- **Don't dump full pages unless asked.** Snippet + path is usually enough. Pull full content only when reasoning genuinely needs it.
- **Respect the project boundary.** The current project is the user's active context. Do not silently switch projects.
- **Honor the rate limit.** 120 req/sec is plenty for sequential work, but parallel page reads can burst close to it. Batch where the API allows (`includeContent: true` on search avoids N+1 reads).
- **Never leak the token.** Headers are safe; query params and your own output text are not.
